### Journal Reflection

1. **How do I approach designing software?**  
   I begin by clarifying functional requirements and sketching a high-level architecture—here, that meant separating client responsibilities (user input, display) from server responsibilities (data storage, business logic). I used UML sequence diagrams to model the request/response flow, which helped me spot edge cases early (e.g., handling dropped connections). Breaking the system into discrete modules with clear interfaces improved my ability to reason about each component in isolation. In future projects, I’ll continue applying this modular, diagram-driven approach to ensure my designs remain scalable and maintainable.

2. **How do I approach developing programs?**  
   My development strategy centers on iterative prototyping and continuous testing. I started with a minimal “echo” server and a matching client, then incrementally added features—authentication, data validation, error handling—verifying each step with unit tests and manual trials. Logging was critical for diagnosing socket timeouts and thread synchronization issues. Over the milestones, my code evolved from a single monolithic script to a well-structured package with reusable modules, clear docstrings, and automated test coverage. That iterative cycle of “build → test → refactor” is now central to my workflow.

3. **How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**  
   Building this client–server system deepened my understanding of networking protocols, concurrency management, and inter-process communication—skills I’ll leverage in advanced courses like Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing. Professionally, this hands-on experience with socket programming and multi-threaded servers strengthens my backend development profile, preparing me for roles where reliable, scalable networked applications are essential. The confidence I’ve gained in designing and debugging distributed architectures will be a lasting asset in both my continued education and my career as a software engineer.
